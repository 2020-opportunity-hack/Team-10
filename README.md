## Problem Statement 
Vidyodaya's existing website is a year-old template with so many navigation links, and it is tough for visitors to find the information they are looking for, and it is less appealing.
- How might we modernize our current website?

It is also browser-based. Hence, no HTML Editing or FTP Software Required. SEO Optimization is also taken care of, which allows the users to find content of search engines pretty easily.
A Blog is Built-in and Ready to Go. Wordpress is opensource.
